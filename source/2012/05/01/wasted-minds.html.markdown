Paul [Krugman nails it](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/30/opinion/krugman-wasting-our-minds.html) describing the debt conservatives are passing on to the youth of America:
> But there’s also a war on the young, which is just as real even if it’s better disguised. And it’s doing immense harm, not just to the young, but to the nation’s future…
> We should be expanding student aid, not slashing it. And we should reverse the de facto austerity policies that are holding back the U.S. economy…
> …refusing to spend that money is foolish and shortsighted even in purely fiscal terms. Remember, the young aren’t just America’s future; they’re the future of the tax base, too.
