Been crazy-busy this week, so I only had a chance to really enjoy four articles. Hope you enjoy them, too.

1. ### [Tomorrow's Web Type Today](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/the-fine-flourish-of-the-ligature/) ###
Elliott Jay Stocks has been on a tear lately publishing three articles about what's possible on the bleeding edge of Web type with his Tomorrow's Web Type Today series. Definitely some good inspiration here to check out what's possible with some Open Type features on the web.

* [Expert Subsets in CSS3](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/expert-subsets-for-css-in-123/)
* [Say it with a Swash](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/say-it-with-a-swash/)

2. ### [Why Flipping Through Paper-Like Pages Endures in the Digital World](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/why-flipping-through-paper-like-pages-endures-in-the-digital-world/all/1) ###
I'm no fan of the skeumorphic page-flipping effect found in iBooks for the iPad, but [Marco](http://marco.org/) shares some thoughts on why he implemented this in his latest release of Instapaper.
> The most ‘authentic’ web-article advancement method, to me, is just scrolling. But I can’t deny that I like pagination better. Scrolling through long articles just feels tedious.

3. ### [The bulk of all human utterances is plagiarism](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/05/bulk-of-all-human-utterances-is.html) ###
In a letter to Helen Keller in 1903, Mark Twain sums up why all of human knowledge is plagiarism of one form or another:
> …ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest.

4. ### [What Is and Is Not A Technology Company](http://al3x.net/2012/05/08/what-is-and-is-not-a-technology-company.html) ###
I never even thought about it before reading this, but Alex Payne of Simple explains what it means to be a technology company, and why many -- such as Zappos, Google, Amazon, and many others -- aren't technology companies at all.
> Put more crudely: sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken, and having an engineer or a data scientist on staff does not make you a technology company.
