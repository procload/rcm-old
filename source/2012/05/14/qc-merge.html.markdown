May 10 - 11, 2012 was the innaugural year for [QCMerge](http://www.qcmerge.com/), a web conference in Cincinnati, and I couldn't be more proud of how it went off.

I've been involved in QCMerge since it's initial planning stages thanks to my work at [Ample](http://www.helloample.com/). There's a ton of people to thank who put on QCMerge, especially the dudes at [Gaslight Software](http://gaslightsoftware.com/), who carried the brunt of the work. There's way too many others to thank, so head on over the the [QCMerge site](http://qcmerge.com/) and see the sponsors and organizers for yourself.

I can't say enough about the quality of the speakers, and how everyone in the Cincinnati community came together and participated in something extremely motivating and rewarding.

We gave a talk on [Responsive Web Design](https://speakerdeck.com/u/procload/p/responsibly-responsive-web-design), and posted the slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/u/procload/p/responsibly-responsive-web-design). The talk was about how the process of designing and developing web sites responsively upends the traditional web design process as we knew it, and hopefully provides some solutions.

We designed and developed the site [RefreshCincy](http://www.refreshcincy.com) for the talk, and officially launched the group at the conference. we hope to build on the momentum generated at QCMerge with RefreshCincy, so follow [RefreshCincy on Twitter](http://twitter.com/refreshcincy) for updates.

It was the first time I gave a public talk, and going into it I didn't know what to expect. But the crowd at QCMerge was awesome, and I couldn't have asked for a better audience for me to lose my speaking virginity to. I'm definitely stoked to start planning 2013's QCMerge and a chance to further interact with the community at RefreshCincy in the coming months.
