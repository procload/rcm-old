When doing work, you shouldn't do so just for the outcome of praise alone. And you should never expect applause. [Seth Godin writes:](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/04/dont-expect-applause.html)
> Who decides if your work is good? When you are at your best, you do. If the work doesn't deliver on its purpose, if the pot you made leaks or the hammer your forged breaks, then you should learn to make a better oneâ€¦ If it's finished, the applause, the thanks, the gratitude are something else. Something extra and not part of what you created. To play a beautiful song for two people or a thousand is the same song, and the amount of thanks you receive isn't part of that song.
