The Font Bureau put together a nice [promo site](http://www.fontbureau.com/NHG/) for Neue Haas Grotesk.
> The digital version of Helvetica that everyone knows and uses today is quite different from the typefaceâ€™s pre-digital design from 1957. Originally released as Neue Haas Grotesk, many of the features that made it a Modernist favorite have been lost in translation over the years from one typesetting technology to the next.

Great brochure site and resource for anyone interested in typography.
