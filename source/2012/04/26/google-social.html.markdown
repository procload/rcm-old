Dustin Curtis nails it [describing Google's social problems](http://dcurt.is/googles-coherent-bouquet):
> Google's current predicament with social is similar to the one Microsoft faced with its tablet PC initiative. Google has about 150 legacy core products which have slowly evolved into great tools over the past decade, but which were designed and built with the complete absence of consideration for any social interaction. Google+ is an attempt to shoe-horn Google's legacy products into things that are compatible with a new set of social interaction paradigms.

I'm all for Google succeeding in the social space, but I, like Dustin, think they need to completely rethink their approach from the groundup, just as Apple did with iOS.
