All the [cool](http://www.marco.org/secondcrack) [kids](http://mattgemmell.com/) have switched to static sites, so I figured it was my time, too.

I simplified the design some, but kept a lot the same. I'm using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) to generate the static site and using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for hosting. There's a few things that are messy around here, so please excuse any errors.

Just wanted to send an update in case anyone saw some weird stuff going on lately. Long follow-up post explaining my setup coming soon.
