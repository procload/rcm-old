A [thoughtful piece](http://counternotions.com/2012/10/09/shouting/) from [Kontra](http://counternotions.com/contact/) on how far online technology journalism has fallen.

> Shouting sells. We’ve known this for a long time. If companies are daft enough to let their ad buyers talk them into spending money on those who shout the most, then publishers would be reckless to leave money on the table. Some publishers say they would like to steer their publications away from yellow journalism, but in a compensation system based solely on pageviews and clicks, they are beholden to a Romneyesque principle: “We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers.”
