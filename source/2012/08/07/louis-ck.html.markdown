I highly recommend this [crazy-good interview](http://www.avclub.com/articles/louis-ck-on-eating-pressure-and-providing-an-alter,82102/) with the hardest working man in show business, Louis C.K.

On of my favorite quotes:
> Money is a resource. It’s an energy that you can inject into things, and it makes stuff happen. This money was like an intention that was pushed toward me, and I thought, “If I keep pushing it around, this is good. This makes me happy.

The [entire interview](http://www.avclub.com/articles/louis-ck-on-eating-pressure-and-providing-an-alter,82102/) is stocked full of wisdom like this. Go read it. Now.
