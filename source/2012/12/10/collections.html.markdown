I love [this idea](http://nytimes.com/compendium/about/?pagewanted=all) from the New York Times:
>	Compendium invites readers of The New York Times like you to use articles, imagery, videos, and quotations to tell your own stories using New York Times content. Each collection has a description that you can use to introduce the collection as a whole, and each item in your collection has a place for you to describe what was important, interesting, or funny about it. Once created, you can share your collection or link to it from anywhere. Compendium is also a great place to discover and explore interesting stories through a wide variety of collections created by our readers, editors, and reporters.

It reminds me a lot of Evan Williams' [Medium](https://medium.com/).

On a related note, I notice myself getting a lot more useful and interesting content through other sources than RSS and Twitter these days, notably through email newsletters, [Readability's Readlists](http://readlists.com/), and collections like Compendium and Medium. Definitely something going on here.
