    <h2>Cladwell approached <%= link_to "Tate Lucas", "http://tatelucas.com/" %> and myself to rethink the user experience and flow of their product.</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="work-body section-body">
    <p>Cladwell is a web product aimed at guys who know they want to dress well, but either don't have the time to put into finding the right clothes or the knowledge to know what is best.</p>
    <p>The site was rapidly built by developers without much thought put into the user experience. So while the underlying technology was solid, the interface needed a face lift.</p>
    <h3>Static Won't Cut It</h3>
    <p>The client didn't have the budget for native app and wanted the product be responsive and accessible on any screen size.</p>
    <p>Static wireframes weren't going to cut it for the responsive contraints and the level of interaction design required. We used <%= link_to "Middleman", "http://middlemanapp.com" %>, a static-site generator built in Ruby, as a tool that demonstrated our interaction designs to the client in a browser instead of a static file.</p>
    <p>We setup an instance on Heroku and gave the client access to view the prototype whenever they wanted so they could always reference the latest round of revisions, even if they weren't 100 percent complete.</p>
    <p>Since Cladwell is the full-time gig of its founders, the client was heavily involved from the very beginning. We brainstormed ideas on paper, made real-time changes using Chrome's developer tools and tried to get them involved as part of the team rather than simply a paying client.</p>
    <p>Basecamp allowed us to quickly share animated gifs, minor design revisions and content among the whole team without any of us having to slow down.</p>
    <!-- Insert Animated Gif and Wireframe Revision Pictures here -->
    <h3>Bootstrap as Scaffolding</h3>
    <p>We setup the project using Twitter Bootstrap as a foundation to minimize the time spent on redesigning any generic UI elements such as modals and form-control styling. Once we had the wireframes translated into the browser and approved by the client, we took our styles and laid them over Bootstrap's to work closer to a finished product.</p>
    <p>Design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for interaction has its benefits over Photoshop because of its ability to remove abstraction, sometimes it's a necessity to jump into a graphic program for fine-tuning. We took the wireframes for the one section of the site into Photoshop and applied textures, refined typography and a color palette. With these designs in place and approved by the client we were ready to start refining the UI.</p>
    <p>Much of the HTML and CSS was written in modular way it was easy to quickly apply our styles across the site without negatively affecting any work we had done up until that point.</p>
    <h3>Delivering the Product</h3>
    <p>The back-end of Cladwell was built in Rails, which made the hand-off all that much easier since Middleman uses .erb template files. Cladwell's back-end developer was able to cross reference our working prototype to the code he was implementing to make sure the designs matched up.</p>
    <p>Cladwell has since hired a full-time UI designer and changed the layer of paint applied on top of our working prototype, but the user experience, clever interactions and responsive layout all remain intact.</p>
