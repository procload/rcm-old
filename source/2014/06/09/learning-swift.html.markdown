There&rsquo;s no doubt to be a glut of want-to-be iOS developers clamoring for resources to learn Swift after Apple&rsquo;s announcement of the language last week at WWDC. Count me among them.

As someone who for years wanted to dip their toes into the waters of iOS development, the time doesn&rsquo;t seem better than now to give it a go. I compiled the best Swift-language resources I&rsquo;ve found below.

### Sample Apps
* [FlappySwift - FlappyBird in Swift](https://github.com/fullstackio/FlappySwift)
* [SwiftNote - Simple note taking app with today widget and iCloud syncing](https://github.com/mslathrop/SwiftNote)

### Official Apple Resources
* [Swift iBook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329)
* [Welcome to Swift](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/LandingPage/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014345)
